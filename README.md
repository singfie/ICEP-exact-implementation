# ICEP-exact-implementation
An exact implementation of different variants of the Isolated Community Evacuation Problem using the Gurobi solver.
Branches exist for:
- deterministic ICEP (D-ICEP) (deterministic-icep branch)
- stochastic ICEP for planning purposes (S-ICEP) (main branch)
- robust ICEP for response purposes (R-ICEP) (robust-icep branch)
- rolling-horizon ICEP for response purposes (RH-ICEP) (rolling-horizon-icep branch)

The package also includes some work in progress branches on column generation and a step wise solver. These are not functional yet.
